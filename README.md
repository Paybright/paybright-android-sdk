Usage Overview
==============

PayBright integration consists of two steps: Configure and Checkout


## Configure

Set the API Key and token obtained from PayBright in PBConfig once (preferably in the Actvity's `onCreate` method) as follows

```
PBConfig.getInstance().initialize(PBConfig.PBEnvironment.Sandbox,
                                  "API_KEY",
                                  "API_TOKEN");
```

## Checkout

Checkout creation is the process in which a customer uses PayBright to pay for a purchase in your store. This process is governed by `PBInstance` object (which is set up in `PBConfig` shared object), and requires four parameters/objects:

- PBCustomer: details of the customer
- PBCustomerBilling: customer's billing address details
- PBCustomerShipping: customer's shipping address details
- PBProduct: item details


### Customer

```
PBCustomer customerObj = new PBCustomer("cs@paybright.com",
                                        "James",
                                        "Testhetfield",
                                        null);
```

### Customer Billing

```
PBCustomerBilling customerBillingObj = new PBCustomerBilling("270 Rue Olier",
                                                             null,
                                                             "Chicoutimi",
                                                             null,
                                                             "CA", 
                                                             "+1-613-987-6543",
                                                             "QC",
                                                             "G7G 4J3");
```

                                                                "Chicoutimi",
                                                                "Shopify",

                                                                "G7G 4J3");

```

### Product

```
PBProduct productObj = new PBProduct(2625.0,
                                    "CAD",
                                    "PaymentGatewayTesting - #4682855809085",
                                    "#4682855809085",
                                    null,
                                    "sdk",
                                    "4682855809085",
                                    "CA",
                                    "PaymentGatewayTesting",
                                    "https://checkout.shopify.com/services/ping/notify_integration/paybright/19629019",
                                    "https://paymentgatewaytesting.myshopify.com/19629019/checkouts/84044f7a52ff18a84dd1f2b5cd46b387?key=0c4978718a87a00e5ac1456b577b5695",
                                    "https://paymentgatewaytesting.myshopify.com/19629019/checkouts/84044f7a52ff18a84dd1f2b5cd46b387/offsite_gateway_callback");
```

### Instance

```
PBConfig.getInstance().instanceObj = new PBInstance(customerObj,
                                                    customerBillingObj,
                                                    customerShippingObj,
                                                    productObj);
```
### Using Activity

Add PBWebView into your AndroidManifest.xml
```xml
<activity
      android:name="com.paybright.sdk.PBWebView"
      android:screenOrientation="portrait" />
```

Once the `PBInstance` has been constructed, set it in `PBConfig` shared object and you may use `PBViewController`. This initiates the flow which guides the user through the PayBright checkout process. An example of how this is implemented is provided as follows

```
new PBViewController(this, this);
```

The flow ends once the user has successfully confirmed the checkout, canceled the checkout, or encountered an error in the process. In each of these cases, PayBright will send a message to the `PBWebViewDelegate` along with additional information about the result.
